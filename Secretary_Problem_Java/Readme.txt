Simple project for testing the secretary problem, made unnecessarily complex with gradle and testing:

The secretary problem is an example of the use of optimal stopping theory.

I found the problem in a book I was reading, and it sparked my interest, so I decided to write a program
to test its effectiveness.

Of course I could have just written a very simple script to test the problem, but I decided that this would
be a good opportunity to familiarize myself better with Gradle, and test-driven development (though admittedly,
 I wrote the base algorithm before the tests), specifically using the Spock testing framework.

 As of now, the end goal is to add onto this project in my free time until I have an overly complex, yet easy to
 follow way of implementing the 1/e law of best choice, demonstrating its effectiveness with varying input sizes.
